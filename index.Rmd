I'm a political researcher and analyst, interested in studying and promoting democracy in Central America and particularly in Guatemala. I am currently a student in the [Committee on International Relations (CIR)](https://cir.uchicago.edu) master's program at the University of Chicago.

I have published research on political parties and elections for think tanks in Guatemala and Central America, most of which has dealt with campaign finance regulation. I have also collaborated with international cooperation organizations, civil society groups, and carried out consultancies for the private sector.
